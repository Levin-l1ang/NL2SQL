sry but through some detailed learning I found nl2sql base on LLMs is so fking boring, they just use some prompt to solve specific sql database's problems, lack of universality and technical content, I won't make any update until I found anything interesting in this area.

This may be a serious mistake, as the project I established lacked a significant amount of preliminary research, which resulted in a waste of time and energy. In the future, such mistakes may cause even greater losses.I will keep this project as a warning to myself.
